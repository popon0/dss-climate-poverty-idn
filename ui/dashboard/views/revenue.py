"""
Revenue Policy Comparison Analysis Panel for Climate-Poverty Decision Support System.

This module provides comprehensive revenue analysis capabilities comparing adaptive
carbon taxation policies (ANFIS-based) with fixed flat-rate taxation schemes,
enabling evidence-based evaluation of fiscal policy effectiveness and revenue optimization.

Key Comparative Components:
- Adaptive tariff system (ANFIS model-based) vs. Fixed flat-rate comparison
- Provincial revenue generation analysis with aggregated national totals
- Detailed tabular breakdown showing per-province revenue differentials
- Performance metrics highlighting percentage improvements and fiscal impact

Policy Analysis Framework:
- Quantitative assessment of revenue generation under different taxation scenarios
- Provincial-level fiscal impact evaluation supporting decentralized policy decisions
- Comparative visualization enabling identification of revenue optimization opportunities
- Statistical analysis of taxation policy effectiveness across diverse regional contexts

Technical Features:
- Real-time revenue calculation based on provincial emission data and tariff rates
- Dynamic provincial filtering supporting focused regional analysis
- Interactive bar chart visualization with dual-scheme comparison
- Expandable detailed tables for comprehensive fiscal planning support

Academic Significance:
The module implements public finance analysis principles specific to environmental
taxation, providing policymakers with quantitative tools for evaluating the
fiscal implications of carbon pricing mechanisms within poverty alleviation contexts.

Dependencies:
    - streamlit: Interactive web dashboard framework
    - pandas: Financial data manipulation and aggregation
    - plotly: Revenue visualization with comparative analysis
    - Custom computation modules for tariff calculations

    Render comprehensive revenue policy comparison analysis for adaptive vs. flat taxation schemes.

    This function creates detailed fiscal impact assessment comparing ANFIS-based adaptive
    carbon taxation with fixed flat-rate alternatives, providing quantitative evidence
    for policy decision-making and revenue optimization strategies.

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Complete provincial dataset containing emission and tariff information
        year (int): Analysis year for focused fiscal impact assessment
        TH (Theme): Dashboard theme configuration ensuring visual consistency
        provinces (list[str] | None): Optional provincial subset for targeted analysis

    Revenue Calculation Methodology:
        - ANFIS Revenue: Applies model-derived adaptive tariff rates per province
        - Flat Revenue: Applies uniform 30 Rp/kg baseline tariff across all provinces
        - Comparative Analysis: Computes percentage differentials and fiscal implications

    Technical Implementation:
        - Implements trillions-scale revenue computation for national policy context
        - Provides provincial-level disaggregation supporting sub-national planning
        - Applies dynamic filtering based on selected provincial scope
        - Generates interactive visualizations with expandable detail tables

    Analytical Framework:
        The visualization supports public finance analysis principles, enabling
        policymakers to assess fiscal trade-offs between adaptive taxation complexity
        and revenue generation effectiveness within environmental policy frameworks.
